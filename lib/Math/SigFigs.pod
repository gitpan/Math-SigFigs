=head1 NAME

Math::SigFigs - do math with correct handling of significant figures

=head1 SYNOPSIS

If you only need to use CountSigFigs and FormatSigFigs, use the first
form.  If you are going to be doing arithmetic, use the second line.

  use Math::SigFigs;
  use Math::SigFigs qw(:all);

The following routines do simple counting/formatting:

  $n=CountSigFigs($num);
  $num=FormatSigFigs($num,$n);

Use the following routines to do arithmetic operations.

  $num=addSF($n1,$n2);
  $num=subSF($n1,$n2);
  $num=multSF($n1,$n2);
  $num=divSF($n1,$n2);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In many scientific applications, it is useful (and in some cases required)
to be able to format numbers with a given number of significant figures,
or to do math in such a way as to maintain the correct number of
significant figures.  The rules for significant figures are too
complicated to be handled solely using the sprintf function (unless you
happen to be Randal Schwartz :-).

These routines allow you to correctly handle significan figures.

It can count the number of significan figures, format a number to a
given number of significant figures, and do basic arithmetic.

=head1 ROUTINES

=over 4

=item CountSigFigs

  $n=CountSigFigs($N);

This returns the number of significant figures in a number.  It returns
() if $N is not a number.

  $N      $n
  -----   --
  240     2
  240.    3
  241     3
  0240    2
  0.03    1
  0       0
  0.0     0

=item FormatSigFigs

  $str=FormatSigFigs($N,$n)

This returns a string containing $N formatted to $n significant figures.
This will work for all cases except something like "2400" formatted to
3 significant figures.

  $N     $n   $str
  ------ --   -------
  2400    1   2000
  2400    2   2400
  2400    3   2400
  2400    4   2400.
  2400    5   2400.0

  141     3   141.
  141     2   140

  0.039   1   0.04
  0.039   2   0.039

  9.9     1   10
  9.9     2   9.9
  9.9     3   9.90

=item addSF, subSF, multSF, divSF

These routines add/subtract/multiply/divide two numbers while maintaining
the proper number of significant figures.

=head1 KNOWN PROBLEMS

=over 4

=item Without scientific notation, some numbers are ambiguous

These routines do not work with scientific notation (exponents).  As a
result, it is impossible to unambiguously format some numbers.  For
example,

  $str=FormatSigFigs("2400",3);

will by necessity return the string "2400" which does NOT have 3
significant figures.  This is not a bug.  It is simply a fundamental
problem with working with significant figures when not using scientific
notation.
